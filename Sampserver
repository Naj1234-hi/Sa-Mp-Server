        <h2>Guys, you're just joining the server for beta testing.</h2>
        <p>There's still a lot to fix. When you join, can you suggest what is missing from the server?</p>
        <p>Plus, when you enter, there's verification. It's just that I don't have a tutor yet on how to verify. All you have to do is type <strong>/verify</strong>, and then when you enter, type <strong>/settings</strong>. Then a code will appear. Just go to the Discord server and find the channel <strong>"#‚úîÔ∏è‚Ä¢verify-in-game"</strong> and type:</p>
        <p><strong>!verify [your code]</strong></p>
        <p>That's it!</p>
        
        <h3>Discord Server:</h3>
        <a class="discord-link" href="https://discord.gg/Q7XTzpDxF4" target="_blank">Join Our Discord</a>

        <h3>Reminder:</h3>
        <p>This SA-MP server is new, so don't be surprised if the number of members is low. I hope you support me, thanks!</p>

        <h3>Needs:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Helpers for newbies and members who need help.</li>
            <li>Faction members (Police, Government, etc.).</li>
            <li>Staff positions: Teachers, BanAppealer, GangMod, and eight admins for checking bugs.</li>
            <li>Gangs that can fight as long as you have RP. Just ask permission from the staff or admin.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>And lastly...</h3>
        <p>I hope that a kind developer out there will teach me how to code, hehe üòÖ. But just kidding... but if you want, go ahead!</p>
